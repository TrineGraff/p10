We cover some theory about jump detection and model the realized volatility of day-ahead power prices for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Germany.

Based on these tests, we consider ARFIMA, HAR-RV, and HAR-CV-JV models, both with normal and GARCH innovations.

We find that while the theory is based on intraday prices, we still obtain similar results for day-ahead price based calculations.

The HAR-CV-JV model based on the CPR decomposition with GARCH and conditional Student's t-distributed errors to perform best.

\chapter{Preface} \label{ch:preface}
This report is written in the fall of 2017, by group 5.218 from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University. The group consists of three 9th semester mathematics-economics students. 
We recommend reading the chapters in order, and the intended audience of this report are graduate students on a mathematical degree.

This report is written in \LaTeX, and data is imported from \url{energinet.dk} while computations are mostly performed in \Rlang ~using the packages

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Rcpp}\fcite{Rcpp}, for interfacing with C++
	\item \texttt{BH}\fcite{BH}, for Boost headers
	\item \texttt{tidyverse}\fcite{tidyverse}, for data wrangling and plotting
	\item \texttt{sandwich}\fcite{sandwich}, for covariance estimation
	\item \texttt{lmtest}\fcite{lmtest}, for parameter testing
	\item \texttt{rugarch}\fcite{rugarch}, for maximum likelihood estimation of GARCH and ARFIMA models
	\item \texttt{MCS}\fcite{MCS}, for model confidence set bootstrapping
\end{itemize}

In the end of the report there is an appendix containing some extra definitions, and theory that we deem relevant, but is not our main focus.
We also provide an overview of the main C++ and \Rlang ~source code used to obtain our results.

The group would especially like to acknowledge Eduardo Vera-Vald√©s for his supervision and inputs throughout the project period.

}{% the abstract
In the first part of the report we present some theory of the factor model, the lasso model and some of its generalizations such as the elastic net, group lasso and the adaptive lasso. 
Also the optimization algorithms coordinate descent and the least angle regression are introduced to solve the lasso problems and its generalizations.
At last we present some post-selection inference theory for the lasso.
In the last part of the report we consider a dataset of 122 macroeconomic variables, from which we predict the unemployment rate one-step-ahead with the described models.
As a benchmark model we will consider the factor model.
We find that each model considered outperformes that benchmark model, and especially the adaptive lasso model with OLS and lasso weights are preferred.}
